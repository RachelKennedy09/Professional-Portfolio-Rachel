# Rachel Kennedy â€“ Professional Portfolio

Hi! Iâ€™m Rachel Kennedy â€” a passionate and curious front-end developer based in the Rocky Mountains. Iâ€™m currently growing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while building projects that reflect my creativity, compassion, and love for meaningful design.

This portfolio includes real-world websites I've developed for small businesses and mental health services, along with a personal landing page that ties everything together. My focus is on building accessible, intuitive, and visually engaging user experiences.
