# 🌿 Rachel Kennedy – Professional Portfolio

Hi! I’m Rachel Kennedy — a passionate and curious front-end developer based in the Rocky Mountains. I’m currently growing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while building real-world projects that reflect my creativity, compassion, and love for meaningful design.

This portfolio brings together the projects I’ve developed for small businesses, mental health services, and personal practice — all designed to create calm, user-centered digital experiences.
